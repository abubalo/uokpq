UoKPQ (University of Kigali Past Questions) is an academic paper management system that contains a neatly structured database of past exam questions. It addresses the challenges students face in quickly and easily finding the right past exams and Continuous Assessment Test (CAT) questions. 

Currently, when a student needs to access past questions for a certain module, they have three main options:

1. Ask students who have previously taken the module. This method is often ineffective as it's difficult to identify who has completed the specific module.

2. Inquire in fragmented WhatsApp groups, hoping someone with access to the specific paper can share it. The downside is that most students don't always have access to the right paper taught by the correct lecturer.

3. Check the library and physically search through hundreds of papers, hoping to find the right one. This method is time-consuming, and the papers are often not indexed in a way that facilitates easy searching.

UoKPQ is an online paper management system that solves these issues by streamlining the process. Past questions are collated, scanned, and stored in a way that allows students to search for papers online based on specific criteria such as module name, lecturer name, year, trimester, paper code, keywords, and more. This makes it possible to find any paper in less than a minute.

The system offers several benefits:
- Centralized and easily accessible database of past questions
- Efficient search functionality based on multiple criteria
- Time-saving for students preparing for exams
- Improved study resources availability

This project is made possible thanks to dedicated volunteers who have painstakingly and meticulously collated, scanned, and uploaded these papers.

UoKPQ aims to improve the academic experience at the University of Kigali by providing a valuable resource for exam preparation and study, ultimately contributing to improved student performance and satisfaction.
